# Iris Plant Classifier

This is Task-6 of The Sparks Foundation GRIP. In this task we have to classify the data with the help of Decision Tree Classifier algorithm and visulize it also.

In this repository I used Decision Tree Classifier algorithm to identify the class of a Iris plant based on its features. 

Also, I deployed this Machine Learning model on Heroku and created a Web-App (https://irisp.herokuapp.com/).

## Code of Iris Plant Classifier

To understand this repository follow the below steps:

1) First Clone, Fork or Download this repository or you can run Task6.ipynb on Google Colab. 

2) The dataset used is (https://bit.ly/3kXTdox).

3) Now, you can run Task6.ipynb or Task6Colab.ipynb file locally or online.

4) All, the uses and instructions are written in code file itself.

### You can check the deployed App on https://irisp.herokuapp.com/
